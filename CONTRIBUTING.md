## Reporting security issues

We take security seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it 
to their attention right away!

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue, instead send your report privately to 
[foss-security@univ-rennes2.fr](mailto:foss-security@univ-rennes2.fr).

Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it.

## Reporting other issues

A great way to contribute to the project is to send a detailed report when you 
encounter an issue. We always appreciate a well-written, thorough bug report, 
and will thank you for it !

Check that [our issue database](https://github.com/DSI-Universite-Rennes2/check-sectigo-dcv)
doesn't already include that problem or suggestion before submitting an issue. If you 
find a match, you can use the "subscribe" button to get notified on updates. Do *not* 
leave random "+1" or "I have this too" comments, as they only clutter the discussion, 
and don't help resolving it. However, if you have ways to reproduce the issue or 
have additional information that may help resolving the issue, please leave a comment.

When reporting issues, always include:

* The version you used or reference to commit id if you used directly git sources,
* OS version,
* Bash version,

Also include the steps required to reproduce the problem if possible and
applicable. This information will help us review and fix your issue faster.
When sending lengthy log-files, consider posting them as a gist (<https://gist.github.com>).
Don't forget to remove sensitive data from your logfiles before posting (you can
replace those parts with "REDACTED").

## Quick contribution tips and guidelines

This section gives the experienced contributor some tips and guidelines.

### Pull requests are always welcome

Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request ? Found a bug and know how to fix
it ? Do it ! We will appreciate it.
Any significant improvement should be documented as 
[a GitHub issue](https://github.com/DSI-Universite-Rennes2/check-sectigo-dcv/issues)

### Conventions

Fork the repository and make changes on your fork in a custom branch:

* If it's a bug fix branch, name it XXXX-something where XXXX is the number of
    the issue.
* If it's a feature branch, create an enhancement issue to announce
    your intentions, and name it XXXX-something where XXXX is the number of the
    issue.

Write clean code. Universally formatted code promotes ease of writing, reading,
and maintenance.

Pull request descriptions should be as clear as possible and include a reference
to all the issues that they address.

### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your
signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass
it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

```text

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your
commit automatically with `git commit -s`.
